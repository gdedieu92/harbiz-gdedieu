# harbiz-gdedieu => full stack engineer


* * General Disclaimer, i do not paid much attention to .gitignore files for repos, do not hate me :( * *

## The exercise "Random User Generator API (React)" is done in frontend-users web App

#Created with https://create-react-app.dev/ to quick setup and work on the specific features request. 
#Addionally i use antd library for css, components and tables (sort, filter)
#React-csv library for export to csv
#Draggable dnd-kit integrated with antd table

* * Disclaimer, the draggable sort is not handle by the download file (can be done by checking the rendered list in table and then passing that to csv component) * *

#Installation (in terminal)

#Git clone repo

#cd harbiz-gdedieu/frontend-users

#npm install && npm start


## The exercise "Refactoring (NodeJS)" is done in backend-challenge 
* * Refactored code and also change a lil bit the algorithm but searching the same result. * *
* * I had to adjust the code to run the test, with the specific call functions they already have * *
* * The availability algorithm just consider slots splitted by given duration, not any type of combination for practical and easy use * *
* * Can be done also with Typescript to make it more robust * *
